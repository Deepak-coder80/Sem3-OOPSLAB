Write class which contains an integer array and a static function to find the average of that array and other
necessary member functions. Create THREE objects. Read the values into the array using one object, and find the 
average. Let the second object modifies the value by multiplying each element by a certain multiplier. Repeat the 
process of finding the average using first object .Using the third object arrange the numbers in ascending order and 
print.
