Problem Statement:Define a class Date that
contains details like year, month and date. Write a C++ program to check the
validity of the date that you enter and display the next date.


Sample
1 : 02/ 03/ 1990 


Valid,   Next date: 03/03/1990


Sample
2:    29/02/1989  


Not Valid


ALGORITHM:
    1.Start
    2.Define a class named Date with members
      day,month and year and methodes input ,validator and display.
    3.Read the day,month and year from user using input method with the
      object created.
    4.Invok the display method and the display method works as,
        4.1. Call the validator method
            4.1.1. check the month is valid , if not return false
            4.1.2.Check the day is valid , if not return false
            4.1.3.For month is equal to 2 , check whether the year is 
                  leap year or not. If it is a leap year check whether the 
                  date is less than or equal to 29, if not return false.
            4.1.4.If it is not leap yar check whether the day is less than or 
                  equal to 28, if not return false.
            4.1.5.for month equal to 4,6,9 and 11 check whether the day
                  is less or equal to 30 , if not return false.
            4.1.6. all the conditions are statisfied return true.
    5. Store the return value of validator method in a local variable called result
    6.For printing next date,
        6.1.If the month is 2,check whether the year is leap year or not , if it is 
            leap year then chek the day is equal to 29 or not , if it is 29 change the value 
            of day to 1 and increment month by 1.if not increment day by 1.
        6.2.If it is not leap year ,then chek the day is equal to 28 or not , if it is 28 change the value 
            of day to 1 and increment month by 1.if not increment day by 1.
        6.3.If month is equal to 4,6,9 and 11 and day =30then change the value of day=1 and 
            increment the value of month by 1  .else increment
            day by one .
        6.4.If month equal to 12 and date =31 then change the value of day and month
            to 1 and increment year by and .else increment
            date by one  .
        6.5.else , if day =31, change the value of day to 1 and increment value of month
            by one and print the date.else increment
            date by one 
    7.According to value of result variable print the output.If it is true then print valid 
      and the new date updated by step 6.else print not valid.
    8.Stop.
