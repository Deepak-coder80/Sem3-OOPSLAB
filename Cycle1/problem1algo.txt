Problem Statement : A phone number, such as
(212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the area code (212),
the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a C++ program that uses a
structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure
phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have
the user input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers. The
interchange might look like this:
 


Enter your area code, exchange, and number: 415 555 1212


My number is (212) 767-8900


Your number is (415) 555-1212



ALGORITHM:

    1.Start    
    2.Define a structure named Phone with members
      area_code,exchange and number
    3.Create 2 structure variables phone1 and phone2.
    4.Assign
        4.1. area_code of phone1 as 212
        4.2. exchange of phone1 as 767
        4.3. number of phone1 as 8900
    5.Read the area_code,exchange and number of phone2
      from user.
    6.Print both structure variables in the format
     (area_code) exchange-number in each line
    7.Stop
