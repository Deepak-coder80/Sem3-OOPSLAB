Write class which contains an integer array and a static function to find the average of that array and other
necessary member functions. Create THREE objects. Read the values into the array using one object, and find the 
average. Let the second object modifies the value by multiplying each element by a certain multiplier. Repeat the 
process of finding the average using first object .Using the third object arrange the numbers in ascending order and 
print.

algo:
1.Start
2.Define a class with members integer array and size as static members and member functions
  input,average,multiplier , sort and display();
3.Create 3 objects for the class in the main function. Invoke the input method for the first
  object for read the array data.
4.Call the average function for first object and calculate the avarage and print it.
5.Read the number want to multipling number from user.
6.Call the multipiler method with multipling number for the second object created.
7.Again Call the avarage function for the first object.
8.Call the sort method for the 3rd object and sort method will sort array using selection sort.
9.Stop
