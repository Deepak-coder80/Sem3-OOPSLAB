.Write a program to find shortest distance between three coordinates points, representing vertices of a triangle,
 using inline function. Also check the validity of the sides to make a triangle.

 Algorithm:

 1.Start
 2.Read the 3 coordinates from the user
 3.Calculate distance between the coordinates and store.
 4.Pass the 3 distance to the inline function called minimum . it will return
   minimum value among the distance.
 5.Again pass the values to validator function, it will return the triangle is 
   possible or not.
 6. If the validator function return true print valid triangle else not valid.
 7.Stop.
