Write a function called swap() that interchanges two int values belonging
to an object, passed as parameter to it by the calling program. Write a C++
program to demonstrate call by value, call by reference and call by
address.

Algorithm:

1.Start
2.Read two integer value from user.
3.Print the value
4.Pass the value to swap_by_value function . Inside the function swap the variable and print 
5.Print the value of variables in the main function.
6.Pass the value to swap_by_address function . Inside the function swap the variable and print 
7.Print the value of variables  in the main function
8.Pass the value to swap_by_reference function . Inside the function swap the variable and print 
9.Print the value of variable inside the main function
10.Stop
