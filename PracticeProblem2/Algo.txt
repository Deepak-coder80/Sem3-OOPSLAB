Problem Statement: To write a Cpp Program to find the gcd of two numbers

Algorithm:

    1.Start
    2.Read two numbers
    3.Pass the number to the function called findGCD
        3.1. If first number is zero return second number
        3.2. If the second number is zero return first number
        3.3. If first number is greater than second number, return
             findGCD function with values first number modulus second number and the second number and
             repeat from step 3.1
        3.4. else return findGCD function with values first number  and the second number modulus first number and
             repeat from step 3.1
    4. Print the value returned from the findGCD function
    5.Stop
